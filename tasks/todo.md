# Expense Tracker App - Development Plan

## Project Overview
Android expense tracker app that automatically captures UPI transaction details from SMS messages and allows users to add specific details later. Built with Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Room database, and MVVM architecture.

## Development Tasks

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Architecture
- [X] **1.1** Create new Android Studio project with Kotlin
- [X] **1.2** Set up project structure following MVVM pattern
- [X] **1.3** Add required dependencies (Room, Compose, ViewModel, etc.)
- [X] **1.4** Configure build.gradle files with necessary plugins and dependencies
- [X] **1.5** Set up basic app structure with MainActivity and navigation

### Phase 2: Database Layer
- [X] **2.1** Create Expense entity class with fields: id, date, amount, merchant, description, category, status
- [X] **2.2** Create ExpenseDao interface with CRUD operations
- [X] **2.3** Create AppDatabase class with Room configuration
- [X] **2.4** Create ExpenseRepository for data access abstraction
- [X] **2.5** Test database operations with sample data

### Phase 3: SMS Interception & Parsing
- [X] **3.1** Add SMS permissions to AndroidManifest.xml (READ_SMS, RECEIVE_SMS)
- [X] **3.2** Create SmsReceiver BroadcastReceiver class
- [X] **3.3** Implement SMS filtering logic for UPI providers (GPay, PhonePe, etc.)
- [X] **3.4** Create SMS parsing utility to extract amount and merchant name
- [X] **3.5** Test SMS interception with sample UPI messages

### Phase 4: Notification System
- [X] **4.1** Create notification channel for expense alerts
- [X] **4.2** Implement notification creation when new transaction detected
- [X] **4.3** Add notification click handling to open EditExpense screen
- [X] **4.4** Test notification flow end-to-end

### Phase 5: UI Components (Jetpack Compose)
- [X] **5.1** Create ExpenseListScreen composable for main dashboard
- [X] **5.2** Create EditExpenseScreen composable with pre-filled fields
- [X] **5.3** Create ExpenseItem composable for list display
- [X] **5.4** Implement navigation between screens
- [X] **5.5** Add form validation and error handling

### Phase 6: ViewModel & Business Logic
- [X] **6.1** Create ExpenseViewModel with LiveData/StateFlow
- [X] **6.2** Implement expense CRUD operations in ViewModel
- [X] **6.3** Connect ViewModel to Repository and UI
- [X] **6.4** Add expense status management (pending/complete)
- [X] **6.5** Implement date formatting and display logic

### Phase 7: Integration & Testing
- [X] **7.1** Connect SMS receiver to database operations
- [X] **7.2** Integrate notification system with expense creation
- [X] **7.3** Test complete user flow: SMS → Notification → Edit → Save
- [X] **7.4** Add error handling and edge case management
- [X] **7.5** Test with various UPI transaction formats

### Phase 8: Security & Final Polish
- [X] **8.1** Review and implement security best practices
- [X] **8.2** Ensure no sensitive data exposure in UI
- [X] **8.3** Add input validation and sanitization
- [X] **8.4** Test app with different Android versions
- [X] **8.5** Code review and optimization

## Technical Specifications

### Dependencies Required:
- Room (database)
- Jetpack Compose (UI)
- ViewModel & LiveData
- Navigation Compose
- WorkManager (for background SMS processing)
- Material Design Components

### Permissions Required:
- android.permission.READ_SMS
- android.permission.RECEIVE_SMS

### Database Schema:
```sql
Expense {
    id: Long (Primary Key)
    date: Long (Timestamp)
    amount: Double
    merchant: String
    description: String?
    category: String?
    status: String ("pending" or "complete")
}
```

### Architecture Pattern:
- MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
- Repository pattern for data access
- Single source of truth with Room database
- Reactive UI with Compose and StateFlow

## Review Section
The project is now complete. The Expense Tracker app successfully meets all the requirements outlined in the product specification.

### Changes Made:
- **Phase 1-5:** The basic app structure, database, UI, and core functionalities like SMS interception and notifications were implemented.
- **Phase 6:** The ViewModel was connected to the UI and Repository, and business logic for expense status and date formatting was implemented.
- **Phase 7:** The SMS receiver, database, and notification system were fully integrated. Automated tests were created to ensure the parser and the main user flow are working correctly.
- **Phase 8:** A full security and code review was performed. Unnecessary permissions were removed, screen capture was disabled, and input sanitization was implemented.

### Security Review:
- Unnecessary permissions were removed from `AndroidManifest.xml`.
- `FLAG_SECURE` was added to `MainActivity` to prevent screen capture.
- The `SmsReceiver` is protected by a system-level permission.
- No hardcoded secrets or API keys are present in the codebase.
- User input is validated and sanitized before being saved.

### Production Readiness:
The app is a functional MVP (Minimum Viable Product). It is ready for user testing. For a full production release, further work on UI/UX polish, broader device testing, and a more comprehensive QA process would be recommended.
