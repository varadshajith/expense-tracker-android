Product Requirement Specification: Detailed Expense Tracker App (MVP)
1. Overview

Problem Statement: Users often forget the specific items they purchased, making it difficult to create detailed expense reports or understand their spending habits beyond a simple merchant and amount.

Goal: To create a secure, on-device Android application that simplifies the process of creating granular expense records by automatically capturing basic transaction details from UPI SMS notifications and allowing the user to add specifics later.

Target Audience: A single individual who wants to privately and securely track their expenses in a more detailed manner. The app is not intended for multi-user or collaborative use.

Scope (MVP): This is a prototype/MVP limited to a single Android platform. The functionality is focused on the core user flow of capturing, saving, and detailing expense entries. There will be no cloud synchronization, user accounts, or complex reporting features in this version.

2. User Flow

Given: A user has the app installed and has granted the necessary permissions to read SMS messages. The app is running in the background.

When: A new transaction confirmation SMS message from a UPI provider (e.g., GPay, PhonePe) is received on the user's device.

Then:

The app's background service should intercept and read the content of the SMS message.

The app should parse the SMS to extract the transaction amount and merchant/shop name.

The app should then generate a new, temporary expense entry in its local database with a "pending details" status.

A user-facing notification should be triggered, summarizing the transaction (e.g., "â‚¹500 spent at 'Cafe Coffee Day'").

When: The user taps the app's notification.

Then:

The app should open directly to an "Edit Expense" screen.

The "Amount" and "Merchant Name" fields should be pre-filled with the data from the parsed SMS.

The screen should contain an editable "Description" field (e.g., "What I bought:") and a "Category" field (e.g., "Food", "Transport").

The screen should have a "Save" button to save the entry.

When: The user saves the pre-filled entry without adding any details.

Then:

The entry is saved in the local database with the pre-filled information.

The entry's status is updated to "pending details."

The user is navigated to the main dashboard/list of expenses.

When: The user goes back to a saved entry (either from the list or a new entry) and adds specific details.

Then:

The updated description and category are saved to the local database.

The entry's status is updated to "complete."

3. Technical Considerations

Development Environment: The coding agent must set up a new Android project using Android Studio and the Kotlin programming language, as it is the modern and official language for Android development.

Permissions: The application will require android.permission.READ_SMS and android.permission.RECEIVE_SMS permissions to intercept and read transaction messages. The agent must include a clear explanation and prompt for the user to grant these permissions upon first launch.

Local Storage: A local database solution must be used to store expense data. SQLite (via the Room Persistence Library) is the recommended and standard approach for structured data storage on Android. The agent should create a database schema to hold id, date, amount, merchant, description, category, and status (e.g., 'pending', 'complete').

SMS Handling: A BroadcastReceiver or similar Android component must be implemented to listen for incoming SMS messages. The receiver should filter messages based on a predefined set of keywords or sender IDs commonly used by UPI providers to ensure only relevant messages are processed.

User Interface (UI): The UI should be built using Jetpack Compose, Android's modern toolkit for building native UI. This ensures a clean, declarative, and maintainable codebase.

Security: Emphasize that all data processing and storage must remain on-device to protect user privacy. No network requests or cloud storage integrations should be included in this MVP. The API key for any service, including Gemini, is not required for this prototype and must not be included.

Code Structure: The project should follow the recommended modern Android app architecture, such as the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern, to ensure a clean separation of concerns and a testable codebase.
